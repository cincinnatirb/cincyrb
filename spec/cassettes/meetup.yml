        to expand their knowledge and network with other .Netters, but anyone who
        is interested in learning more about .Net is more than welcome. The focus
        of the presentations will be on learning and utilizing the .Net framework
        to the fullest extent, best practices, and cutting edge programming tools
        and new technologies. The meetings start at 6:00 PM; however, we have a social
        time starting at 5:30 PM. At the start of the meetings we do announcements,
        followed by our headliner speaker for 60-90 minutes. After the main talk we
        break for pizza and some more social time. We wrap up the meeting with a short
        \"grok\" talk and usually some giveaways. For more information and to see

        CINNUG group was created to provide a place for practicing .NET developers
        to expand their knowledge and network with other .Netters, but anyone who
        is interested in learning more about .Net is more than welcome. The focus
        of the presentations will be on learning and utilizing the .Net framework
        to the fullest extent, best practices, and cutting edge programming tools
        and new technologies. The meetings start at 6:00 PM; however, we have a social
        time starting at 5:30 PM. At the start of the meetings we do announcements,
        followed by our headliner speaker for 60-90 minutes. After the main talk we
        break for pizza and some more social time. We wrap up the meeting with a short
        \"grok\" talk and usually some giveaways. For more information and to see

        CINNUG group was created to provide a place for practicing .NET developers
        to expand their knowledge and network with other .Netters, but anyone who
        is interested in learning more about .Net is more than welcome. The focus
        of the presentations will be on learning and utilizing the .Net framework
        to the fullest extent, best practices, and cutting edge programming tools
        and new technologies. The meetings start at 6:00 PM; however, we have a social
        time starting at 5:30 PM. At the start of the meetings we do announcements,
        followed by our headliner speaker for 60-90 minutes. After the main talk we
        break for pizza and some more social time. We wrap up the meeting with a short
        \"grok\" talk and usually some giveaways. For more information and to see

        CINNUG group was created to provide a place for practicing .NET developers
        to expand their knowledge and network with other .Netters, but anyone who
        is interested in learning more about .Net is more than welcome. The focus
        of the presentations will be on learning and utilizing the .Net framework
        to the fullest extent, best practices, and cutting edge programming tools
        and new technologies. The meetings start at 6:00 PM; however, we have a social
        time starting at 5:30 PM. At the start of the meetings we do announcements,
        followed by our headliner speaker for 60-90 minutes. After the main talk we
        break for pizza and some more social time. We wrap up the meeting with a short
        \"grok\" talk and usually some giveaways. For more information and to see

        CINNUG group was created to provide a place for practicing .NET developers
        to expand their knowledge and network with other .Netters, but anyone who
        is interested in learning more about .Net is more than welcome. The focus
        of the presentations will be on learning and utilizing the .Net framework
        to the fullest extent, best practices, and cutting edge programming tools
        and new technologies. The meetings start at 6:00 PM; however, we have a social
        time starting at 5:30 PM. At the start of the meetings we do announcements,
        followed by our headliner speaker for 60-90 minutes. After the main talk we
        break for pizza and some more social time. We wrap up the meeting with a short
        \"grok\" talk and usually some giveaways. For more information and to see

        CINNUG group was created to provide a place for practicing .NET developers
        to expand their knowledge and network with other .Netters, but anyone who
        is interested in learning more about .Net is more than welcome. The focus
        of the presentations will be on learning and utilizing the .Net framework
        to the fullest extent, best practices, and cutting edge programming tools
        and new technologies. The meetings start at 6:00 PM; however, we have a social
        time starting at 5:30 PM. At the start of the meetings we do announcements,
        followed by our headliner speaker for 60-90 minutes. After the main talk we
        break for pizza and some more social time. We wrap up the meeting with a short
        \"grok\" talk and usually some giveaways. For more information and to see
