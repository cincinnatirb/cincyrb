        up with the CINNUG Community online<br/>This month, we will be catching up
        with our community online using Zoom.</p> <p>CINNUG:</p> <p>A Day in the Life
        of a Developer using GitHub for Better DevOps<br/>With over 50 million users
        worldwide and 100 million repositories, GitHub is the center of the open source
        universe. Yet GitHub is also a wonderful platform for practicing good DevOps
        with your private and inner-source projects. In this session Brian will show
        you how a developer could use GitHub to manage source code, build it and release
        it to the Azure Cloud. We\u2019ll look at good flow with GitHub Issues, Repos,
        and Actions.</p> <p>About our Speaker:<br/>Brian A. Randell is a partner with
        MCW Technologies, LLC. You can find him writing code\u2014mostly C# and T-SQL\u2014and
        helping teams via consulting and training on DevOps. He\u2019s co-authored
        a couple of books, written some articles you might have read, and speaks regularly
        at conferences including VSLive where he\u2019s a co-chair. When he\u2019s
        not working, Brian enjoys spending time with his wife of 24 years, two children,
        and their dog; as well as driving his M5, listening to old and new \u201cheavy
        metal\u201d.</p> <p>You can reach Brian via Twitter, @brianrandell, read his

        Regulated and Compliance-focused Companies Need DevOps</p> <p>Whether it''s
        PCI, HIPAA, or SOX, companies that are under regulatory scrutiny typically
        rely on legacy methods and tools to prove compliance. Unfortunately, most
        highly regulated companies (and auditors) are often slow to accept new methods
        of software delivery such as Agile and DevOps, including fully automated infrastructure,
        continuous delivery, and rights management. In reality, these methods are
        not only more effective, they improve compliance - from end to end tractability
        to consistent, secure systems.</p> <p>This talk will include several key concepts,
        tools, and techniques that take the pain out of audits, improve security,
        and allow teams to focus on product development at market speed. Misconceptions
        about automated processes, misinterpretation of regulatory guidelines, and
        reinforcement of the actual outcome - privacy and security - will be discussed
        and demonstrated. It''s time to improve not only compliance, but overall delivery
        and dispel the fear of automation.</p> <p>About Kurt Crowley</p> <p>Kurt Crowley
        is a technology leader with 18 years of success across all aspects of technology
        lifecycle management, having led software, infrastructure, operations, and
        project management teams. His background includes technology initiatives in
        financial services, health care, education, non-profit, government, ecommerce,
        insurance and other domains. Kurt\u2019s reputation for achieving positive
        business outcomes and innovation rest in his ability to understand deep technical
        concepts, as well as emerging organizational and delivery techniques. Kurt
        is as comfortable with strategy and leadership of large scale initiatives
        as he is doing \u201chands on\u201d development, including cutting edge DevOps

        you ever think \"this admin task is just too hard?\" Us too... and we decided
        to do something about it! Let''s face it, Microsoft Windows is an increasingly
        complex ecosystem. While APIs are more available, it can be confusing to use
        them well. Fantastic is an open source tool which allows you to leverage things
        like PowerShell in an easy to use web GUI. Attendees of this talk will be
        introduced to the tool, learn about the goals of this project, and why we
        think this is a way to combat the ever increasing complexity of systems administration.</p>

        Regulated and Compliance-focused Companies Need DevOps</p> <p>Whether it''s
        PCI, HIPAA, or SOX, companies that are under regulatory scrutiny typically
        rely on legacy methods and tools to prove compliance. Unfortunately, most
        highly regulated companies (and auditors) are often slow to accept new methods
        of software delivery such as Agile and DevOps, including fully automated infrastructure,
        continuous delivery, and rights management. In reality, these methods are
        not only more effective, they improve compliance - from end to end tractability
        to consistent, secure systems.</p> <p>This talk will include several key concepts,
        tools, and techniques that take the pain out of audits, improve security,
        and allow teams to focus on product development at market speed. Misconceptions
        about automated processes, misinterpretation of regulatory guidelines, and
        reinforcement of the actual outcome - privacy and security - will be discussed
        and demonstrated. It''s time to improve not only compliance, but overall delivery
        and dispel the fear of automation.</p> <p>About Kurt Crowley</p> <p>Kurt Crowley

        up with the CINNUG Community online<br/>This month, we will be catching up
        with our community online using GoTo Meeting. We are limited this month to
        25 attendees. Working on expanding that number.</p> <p>CINNUG:</p> <p>Come
        join us as we cover a variety of technology and soft skill talks led by speakers
        from all around the country. The technology deals with the hottest topics
        of the day including (but not limited to) .NET, SQL Server, mobile, HTML/JS,
        and much, much more! The meeting starts at 6:00 with the headliner, followed
        by pizza and pop (provided by our generous sponsors). Immediately after pizza,
        we re-convene for CINARC.</p> <p>CINARC:</p> <p>Come join this new special
        interest group as we discuss topics related to software architecture. This
        meeting is run after CINNUG using the open fishbowl technique where the attendees
        are encouraged to share their thoughts with everyone while keeping the meeting
        from becoming a free for all. :) What topic will we cover? Well, that''s up
        to the attendees! If you have a strong opinion about a topic you''d like to
        suggest, or want to learn more about the topics then make sure you swing by

        Regulated and Compliance-focused Companies Need DevOps</p> <p>Whether it''s
        PCI, HIPAA, or SOX, companies that are under regulatory scrutiny typically
        rely on legacy methods and tools to prove compliance. Unfortunately, most
        highly regulated companies (and auditors) are often slow to accept new methods
        of software delivery such as Agile and DevOps, including fully automated infrastructure,
        continuous delivery, and rights management. In reality, these methods are
        not only more effective, they improve compliance - from end to end tractability
        to consistent, secure systems.</p> <p>This talk will include several key concepts,
        tools, and techniques that take the pain out of audits, improve security,
        and allow teams to focus on product development at market speed. Misconceptions
        about automated processes, misinterpretation of regulatory guidelines, and
        reinforcement of the actual outcome - privacy and security - will be discussed
        and demonstrated. It''s time to improve not only compliance, but overall delivery
        and dispel the fear of automation.</p> <p>About Kurt Crowley</p> <p>Kurt Crowley
        is a technology leader with 18 years of success across all aspects of technology
        lifecycle management, having led software, infrastructure, operations, and

        25 attendees. Working on expanding that number.</p> <p>CINNUG:</p> <p>Come
        join us as we cover a variety of technology and soft skill talks led by speakers
        from all around the country. The technology deals with the hottest topics
        of the day including (but not limited to) .NET, SQL Server, mobile, HTML/JS,
        and much, much more! The meeting starts at 6:00 with the headliner, followed
        by pizza and pop (provided by our generous sponsors). Immediately after pizza,
        we re-convene for CINARC.</p> <p>CINARC:</p> <p>Come join this new special
        interest group as we discuss topics related to software architecture. This
        meeting is run after CINNUG using the open fishbowl technique where the attendees
        are encouraged to share their thoughts with everyone while keeping the meeting
        from becoming a free for all. :) What topic will we cover? Well, that''s up
        to the attendees! If you have a strong opinion about a topic you''d like to

        Regulated and Compliance-focused Companies Need DevOps</p> <p>Whether it''s
        PCI, HIPAA, or SOX, companies that are under regulatory scrutiny typically
        rely on legacy methods and tools to prove compliance. Unfortunately, most
        highly regulated companies (and auditors) are often slow to accept new methods
        of software delivery such as Agile and DevOps, including fully automated infrastructure,
        continuous delivery, and rights management. In reality, these methods are
        not only more effective, they improve compliance - from end to end tractability
        to consistent, secure systems.</p> <p>This talk will include several key concepts,
        tools, and techniques that take the pain out of audits, improve security,
        and allow teams to focus on product development at market speed. Misconceptions
        about automated processes, misinterpretation of regulatory guidelines, and
        reinforcement of the actual outcome - privacy and security - will be discussed
        and demonstrated. It''s time to improve not only compliance, but overall delivery
        and dispel the fear of automation.</p> <p>About Kurt Crowley</p> <p>Kurt Crowley

        Regulated and Compliance-focused Companies Need DevOps</p> <p>Whether it''s
        PCI, HIPAA, or SOX, companies that are under regulatory scrutiny typically
        rely on legacy methods and tools to prove compliance. Unfortunately, most
        highly regulated companies (and auditors) are often slow to accept new methods
        of software delivery such as Agile and DevOps, including fully automated infrastructure,
        continuous delivery, and rights management. In reality, these methods are
        not only more effective, they improve compliance - from end to end tractability
        to consistent, secure systems.</p> <p>This talk will include several key concepts,
        tools, and techniques that take the pain out of audits, improve security,
        and allow teams to focus on product development at market speed. Misconceptions
        about automated processes, misinterpretation of regulatory guidelines, and
        reinforcement of the actual outcome - privacy and security - will be discussed
        and demonstrated. It''s time to improve not only compliance, but overall delivery
        and dispel the fear of automation.</p> <p>About Kurt Crowley</p> <p>Kurt Crowley
        is a technology leader with 18 years of success across all aspects of technology
        lifecycle management, having led software, infrastructure, operations, and

        join us as we cover a variety of technology and soft skill talks led by speakers
        from all around the country. The technology deals with the hottest topics
        of the day including (but not limited to) .NET, SQL Server, mobile, HTML/JS,
        and much, much more! The meeting starts at 6:00 with the headliner, followed
        by pizza and pop (provided by our generous sponsors). Immediately after pizza,
        we re-convene for CINARC.</p> <p>CINARC:</p> <p>Come join this new special
        interest group as we discuss topics related to software architecture. This
        meeting is run after CINNUG using the open fishbowl technique where the attendees
        are encouraged to share their thoughts with everyone while keeping the meeting
        from becoming a free for all. :) What topic will we cover? Well, that''s up
        to the attendees! If you have a strong opinion about a topic you''d like to

        up with the CINNUG Community online<br/>This month, we will be catching up
        with our community online using GoTo Meeting. We are limited this month to
        25 attendees. Working on expanding that number.</p> <p>CINNUG:</p> <p>Come
        join us as we cover a variety of technology and soft skill talks led by speakers
        from all around the country. The technology deals with the hottest topics
        of the day including (but not limited to) .NET, SQL Server, mobile, HTML/JS,
        and much, much more! The meeting starts at 6:00 with the headliner, followed
        by pizza and pop (provided by our generous sponsors). Immediately after pizza,
        we re-convene for CINARC.</p> <p>CINARC:</p> <p>Come join this new special
        interest group as we discuss topics related to software architecture. This
        meeting is run after CINNUG using the open fishbowl technique where the attendees
        are encouraged to share their thoughts with everyone while keeping the meeting
        from becoming a free for all. :) What topic will we cover? Well, that''s up
        to the attendees! If you have a strong opinion about a topic you''d like to
        suggest, or want to learn more about the topics then make sure you swing by

        Regulated and Compliance-focused Companies Need DevOps</p> <p>Whether it''s
        PCI, HIPAA, or SOX, companies that are under regulatory scrutiny typically
        rely on legacy methods and tools to prove compliance. Unfortunately, most
        highly regulated companies (and auditors) are often slow to accept new methods
        of software delivery such as Agile and DevOps, including fully automated infrastructure,
        continuous delivery, and rights management. In reality, these methods are
        not only more effective, they improve compliance - from end to end tractability
        to consistent, secure systems.</p> <p>This talk will include several key concepts,
        tools, and techniques that take the pain out of audits, improve security,
        and allow teams to focus on product development at market speed. Misconceptions
        about automated processes, misinterpretation of regulatory guidelines, and
        reinforcement of the actual outcome - privacy and security - will be discussed
        and demonstrated. It''s time to improve not only compliance, but overall delivery
        and dispel the fear of automation.</p> <p>About Kurt Crowley</p> <p>Kurt Crowley

        up with the CINNUG Community online<br/>This month, we will be catching up
        with our community online using GoTo Meeting. We are limited this month to
        25 attendees. Working on expanding that number.</p> <p>CINNUG:</p> <p>Come
        join us as we cover a variety of technology and soft skill talks led by speakers
        from all around the country. The technology deals with the hottest topics
        of the day including (but not limited to) .NET, SQL Server, mobile, HTML/JS,
        and much, much more! The meeting starts at 6:00 with the headliner, followed
        by pizza and pop (provided by our generous sponsors). Immediately after pizza,
        we re-convene for CINARC.</p> <p>CINARC:</p> <p>Come join this new special
        interest group as we discuss topics related to software architecture. This
        meeting is run after CINNUG using the open fishbowl technique where the attendees
        are encouraged to share their thoughts with everyone while keeping the meeting
        from becoming a free for all. :) What topic will we cover? Well, that''s up
        to the attendees! If you have a strong opinion about a topic you''d like to
        suggest, or want to learn more about the topics then make sure you swing by
        the meeting. Find out more at [url=<a href=\"http://cinnug.org]http://cinnug.org[/url\"

        Regulated and Compliance-focused Companies Need DevOps</p> <p>Whether it''s
        PCI, HIPAA, or SOX, companies that are under regulatory scrutiny typically
        rely on legacy methods and tools to prove compliance. Unfortunately, most
        highly regulated companies (and auditors) are often slow to accept new methods
        of software delivery such as Agile and DevOps, including fully automated infrastructure,
        continuous delivery, and rights management. In reality, these methods are
        not only more effective, they improve compliance - from end to end tractability
        to consistent, secure systems.</p> <p>This talk will include several key concepts,
        tools, and techniques that take the pain out of audits, improve security,
        and allow teams to focus on product development at market speed. Misconceptions
        about automated processes, misinterpretation of regulatory guidelines, and
        reinforcement of the actual outcome - privacy and security - will be discussed
        and demonstrated. It''s time to improve not only compliance, but overall delivery
        and dispel the fear of automation.</p> <p>About Kurt Crowley</p> <p>Kurt Crowley

        lifecycle management, having led software, infrastructure, operations, and

        with our community online using Zoom. Each month will have a different link,
        posted here for those who register.</p> <p>CINNUG:</p> <p>Come join us as
        we cover a variety of technology and soft skill talks led by speakers from
        all around the country. The technology deals with the hottest topics of the
        day including (but not limited to) .NET, SQL Server, mobile, HTML/JS, and
        much, much more! The meeting starts at 6:00 with the headliner, followed by
        pizza and pop (provided by our generous sponsors). Immediately after pizza,
        we re-convene for CINARC.<br/>NOTE: Due to being remote, pizza and pop will
        not be provided.</p> <p>CINARC:</p> <p>Come join this new special interest
        group as we discuss topics related to software architecture. This meeting
        is run after CINNUG using the open fishbowl technique where the attendees
        are encouraged to share their thoughts with everyone while keeping the meeting
        from becoming a free for all. :) What topic will we cover? Well, that''s up
        to the attendees! If you have a strong opinion about a topic you''d like to
        suggest, or want to learn more about the topics then make sure you swing by

        with our community online using Zoom. Each month will have a different link,
        posted here for those who register.</p> <p>CINNUG:</p> <p>Come join us as
        we cover a variety of technology and soft skill talks led by speakers from
        all around the country. The technology deals with the hottest topics of the
        day including (but not limited to) .NET, SQL Server, mobile, HTML/JS, and
        much, much more! The meeting starts at 6:00 with the headliner, followed by
        pizza and pop (provided by our generous sponsors). Immediately after pizza,
        we re-convene for CINARC.<br/>NOTE: Due to being remote, pizza and pop will
        not be provided.</p> <p>CINARC:</p> <p>Come join this new special interest
        group as we discuss topics related to software architecture. This meeting
        is run after CINNUG using the open fishbowl technique where the attendees
        are encouraged to share their thoughts with everyone while keeping the meeting
        from becoming a free for all. :) What topic will we cover? Well, that''s up
        to the attendees! If you have a strong opinion about a topic you''d like to

        we cover a variety of technology and soft skill talks led by speakers from

        much, much more! The meeting starts at 6:00 with the headliner, followed by
        pizza and pop (provided by our generous sponsors). Immediately after pizza,
        we re-convene for CINARC.<br/>NOTE: Due to being remote, pizza and pop will
        not be provided.</p> <p>CINARC:</p> <p>Come join this new special interest
        group as we discuss topics related to software architecture. This meeting
        is run after CINNUG using the open fishbowl technique where the attendees
        are encouraged to share their thoughts with everyone while keeping the meeting
        from becoming a free for all. :) What topic will we cover? Well, that''s up
